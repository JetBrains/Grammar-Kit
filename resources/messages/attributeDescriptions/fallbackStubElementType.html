<p>Allows specifying a fallback class to use for an elementType in the constructor of stub elements.</p>

<p>Usually the parser generator looks into the parent class file to detect which class to use.
  But in some cases a parent class file may not be available (not yet compiled).
  In this case, it uses `IStubElementType` by default, which may not be the case in the modern code when `IElementType` should be used.
</p>

<p>This is per parser option. It does not allow overriding the default per rule.</p>
